# [Persistent Jobs Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/derailvalley/mods/794) for [Derail Valley](http://www.derailvalley.com)

*I have been here before. I remember this job that I couldn't take last time. So glad it's still here!*

This mod changes the job and car spawning system such that jobs and cars are kept in stations even if you leave them for a longer period of time. This way, you can shunt, build larger consists of cars of multiple jobs that go to the same destination, haul to one destination and come back for the next. Everything will be as you left it.

If you finish (or abandon) a job, the cars of that job will be used for new jobs. Finishing a shunting unload job will leave those cars jobless for some time. Once you leave the station and come back again a bit later, those cars will have new jobs reassigned to them!

Stations only generate new cars once, when you enter them the first time. This also means that cars are finite once all station have generated.

This is a continuation of the great work that Niko Fox (fauxnix) started with the original but [discontinued Persistent Jobs mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/derailvalley/mods/151).
